Overview of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) Application
Objective:
The primary objective of the TTS application is to convert text input by the user into spoken words. The application aims to support multiple languages and voices, providing options for users to customize the speech synthesis according to their preferences. This can be useful for accessibility, language learning, and general convenience.

Key Elements:

Text Input: Interface for users to enter the text they want to convert to speech.
Language Support: Ability to select different languages for speech synthesis.
Voice Selection: Options to choose from various available voices.
Speech Parameters: Customization options for speech rate and volume.
Audio Output: Generating and playing the audio corresponding to the input text.
Technology Used
Programming Language:

Python: Chosen for its simplicity and extensive library support for TTS and audio processing.
Libraries and Tools:

pyttsx3:

A Python library for text-to-speech conversion.
Works offline and supports multiple TTS engines.
Allows customization of voice, speech rate, and volume.
Visual Studio:

An integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing, debugging, and running the Python application.
Provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing Python projects and environments.
Additional Libraries (Optional for enhancement):

Tkinter: For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly.
gTTS: Google Text-to-Speech library for high-quality voice synthesis (requires internet access).
Implementation Steps
